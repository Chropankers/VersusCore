I remember spending nights huddled underneath a loft bed, sitting at a computer my uncle bought me because he saw this growing fascination I had with technology. I remember the sounds of internet shows in the background while I learned about hardware, software, history—anything I could get my hands on.

I loved Soul Calibur II. I played it almost weekly. I loved Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat.
And then I stumbled onto something called MUGEN.

I installed it, and the menu felt like a gateway into another world. I didn’t know at the time that it was a recreation of King of Fighters 2000—but it didn’t matter. The idea that I could load all these different characters into one game and watch their designs collide was mesmerizing. I discovered worlds and characters I never would have encountered otherwise.

As the years went on and MUGEN became harder and harder to work with, something inside me grew restless. The genre that had shepherded me into a STEM field—a place of safety—felt like it was losing its spark. Innovation slowed. Profit overtook expression. The scene, somehow, was growing and shrinking at the same time. I could feel the stagnation. I could feel that something was missing.

And when the urge finally hit me to do something about it, I wanted to ignore it.
Projects like this get big. They get impossible. They get abandoned.

I always thought of myself more as a writer—even before becoming a software development student. I never imagined myself as someone who would build a foundation, an engine, a framework. That didn’t feel like my place on the stage of history.

But then I remembered those formative nights—through depression, hospital visits, pills, uncertainty—when games kept me grounded, kept me sane. When competing in tournaments (however poorly) gave me friends and community. All of it was formative. All of it mattered. And all of it came from a genre that had once given me everything.

And I realized: someone has to give something back.

I want to empower that kid who always dreamed of making a MUGEN character, or a MUGEN full game, or their own fighting game entirely—the tool I never had.
I want to give a new generation the freedom to create without permission.
I want to bring innovation back into a space that desperately needs it.

To fight for the future is one of the most honest things the FGC can do.
And whether you realize it or not, if you love this genre, you are part of the FGC too.

So here is my offering.
Not just a game, but a framework.
A foundation.
A new stage of history.

With VersusCore, you can build something like MUGEN, or you can use it as the backbone of your own original creation. Either way, we all benefit when creativity is unleashed—freed from stagnation, freed from gatekeeping, allowed to run wild across the stage of ages.

Engineered to fight for the future, one idea at a time.
